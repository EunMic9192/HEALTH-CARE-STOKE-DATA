# Stroke Prediction Analysis

## Dataset Overview
This project analyzes stroke risk factors using a healthcare dataset of 5110 patient records containing both demographic and medical information. The dataset includes the following features:
- id: Unique identifier
- gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
- age: Age of the patient
- hypertension: 0 (no) or 1 (yes)
- heart_disease: 0 (no) or 1 (yes)
- ever_married: "Yes" or "No"
- work_type: Type of employment
- Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
- avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in blood
- bmi: Body Mass Index
- smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"
- stroke: 0 (no stroke) or 1 (had stroke)

## Project Goals
- Identify key predictors of stroke occurrence
- Analyze relationships between medical conditions and stroke risk
- Build predictive models to assess stroke likelihood
- Provide insights for early intervention strategies

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing BMI values)
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Statistical testing of risk factor relationships
- Implementation of machine learning classification models

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for modeling
